Haskell bindings to the Google Static Maps API

This respository has no connection with Google Inc. or its affiliates.

The [Google Static Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/static-maps/intro)
returns a map as an image via an HTTP request. This library provides bindings in
Haskell to that API.

NB: The use of the Google Static Maps API services is subject to the
[Google Maps APIs Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/maps/terms),
which terms restrict the use of content.

In the light of the 'End User Terms and Privacy Policy' clauses of those terms,
by using the library in this repository you are agreeing to be bound by Google's
Terms of Service.
